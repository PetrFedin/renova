# Renova — Integration Master Plan

**Document:** `docs/RENOVA_INTEGRATION_MASTER_PLAN_2026-10-01.md`  
**Status:** PLANNED  
**Date:** 2026-10-01  
**Repository:** `PetrFedin/renova`

## Purpose

This file is the canonical integration roadmap for strengthening Renova without replacing its existing authorities. A future instruction to implement this document means executing the phases below in order, preserving the current Project/Works/Budget/Acceptance/Payments/Documents authorities.

This roadmap is not evidence that listed capabilities are already live.

## Baseline that must remain authoritative

Renova already has a strong mobile + API core, offline queue, project lifecycle, acceptance, payment lifecycle, document OCR, e-sign provider boundaries, notifications, audit/event patterns and extensive mobile/E2E coverage.

Therefore this plan does **not** introduce a second project-management system, a second document source of truth or a second payment authority.

## Integration decisions

| Capability | External source | Decision | Boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Digital Site Diary | native Renova domain | ADOPT | Renova-owned daily execution record |
| Plan/photo markup | Shopify React Native Skia | ADOPT | UI/capture only |
| Resumable evidence upload | tus-js-client + tusd | ADOPT/SIDECAR | upload transport only |
| Drawing/PDF review | PDF.js | ADOPT | viewer only |
| Before/after alignment | OpenCV | ADAPT | worker-derived evidence |
| Trusted media provenance | C2PA | ADAPT | evidence metadata, not business authority |
| 360 progress views | Pannellum | ADOPT | presentation layer |
| Punch/Hold Point model | native | ADOPT | execution authority |
| Change Impact Engine | Timefold patterns | ADAPT | planning/simulation only |
| BIM/IFC | web-ifc | DEFER/ADAPT | read/extract model context |
| Collaborative sketching | Excalidraw patterns | ADAPT | annotation surface |
| E-sign | Documenso patterns/provider | ADAPT | current Renova signing authority remains |
| Document archive patterns | Paperless | REFERENCE | OCR already exists in Renova |
| Supplier/contractor CRM patterns | Twenty | REFERENCE/ADAPT | scorecard native in Renova |
| Invoice patterns | Invoice Ninja | REFERENCE | payments/invoices remain Renova |
| Asset/tool registry | Snipe-IT patterns | REFERENCE | only if equipment control enters scope |
| Portfolio PM | OpenProject patterns | REFERENCE | do not replace Renova project authority |
| Large-list performance | FlashList | ADOPT | mobile rendering only |

## Phase 0 — Preserve current Golden Path

Before new integrations:

1. Keep the existing project lifecycle and payment/acceptance golden paths green.
2. Confirm PostgreSQL is authoritative in deployed environments.
3. Keep outbox/audit/event behavior intact.
4. Add migration + API + mobile contract tests for every new execution entity.

No feature below may bypass current project ACL or team access checks.

## Phase 1 — Digital Site Diary

Create native entities:

- site_day;
- work_log;
- workforce_log;
- material_delivery;
- blocker;
- weather/context note where relevant;
- evidence_attachment;
- responsible contractor/team.

Flow:

`project -> room/work package -> site day -> work performed -> evidence -> issue/hold point -> acceptance`

The diary must be generated from real project/work IDs, not free-floating notes.

### Acceptance

- one project-day has one canonical diary;
- entries are append/audit safe;
- contractor/customer visibility follows ACL;
- evidence links are immutable references;
- daily summary can be exported but export is not authority.

## Phase 2 — Punch List + Hold Points

Strengthen current acceptance/punch functionality into structured execution control.

Add:

- defect/punch item;
- severity;
- location/room/work package;
- responsible party;
- due date;
- hold-point flag;
- required evidence;
- reinspection;
- closed/accepted state.

A hold point blocks the configured next work/payment milestone until explicitly released by an authorised role.

Do not duplicate existing Acceptance entities. Punch/Hold Point must reference and feed the current acceptance canon.

## Phase 3 — Evidence Capture UX

### React Native Skia

Use for:

- draw defect polygon/arrow/text on photo;
- mark plan area;
- dimension/measurement annotation;
- compare markup revisions.

Store annotation geometry separately from the source image so the original stays immutable.

### tus upload

Use resumable upload for:

- long site videos;
- 360 captures;
- high-resolution evidence packs.

Flow:

`create upload intent -> resumable transport -> checksum -> quarantine -> object storage -> evidence admitted`

A completed upload is not accepted evidence until server checksum/ACL/admission succeeds.

### FlashList

Use only where long lists materially improve mobile performance: expenses, evidence, messages, materials, work packages.

## Phase 4 — Trusted Photo / Before-After Evidence

### OpenCV worker

Derive:

- image alignment;
- common viewpoint estimate;
- crop/registration suggestion;
- visual-difference preview.

Never auto-declare a defect fixed from CV output.

### C2PA

Where supported, persist content credentials/provenance metadata for captured or imported media. C2PA proves provenance statements, not that the construction work is correct.

### 360 / Pannellum

Attach panorama to room + date + work package. Timeline view should allow switching between captures from the same room.

Order: normal photo evidence first -> stable storage/checksum -> 360 second.

## Phase 5 — Documents, Drawings and BIM

### PDF.js

Embed project drawings/contracts/specifications with:

- page deep links;
- referenced comments;
- issue-to-page anchors;
- search/highlight.

### Excalidraw patterns

Use as a bounded sketch/annotation mode. Exported sketch stores structured source + rendered preview, linked to project/work package.

### web-ifc

Only after ordinary plan/PDF workflows are stable.

Use IFC as contextual read model:

`IFC element -> room/system/component -> Renova work package/issue/evidence`

Do not make IFC the source of project financial or acceptance state.

### Paperless

Reference taxonomy/retention/document UX only. Do not introduce a second OCR/archive authority because Renova already has OCR/document handling.

## Phase 6 — Change Impact Engine

Reference: Timefold optimisation patterns.

Trigger:

`change request -> affected work packages/materials/resources -> delta cost -> delta time -> conflicts -> approval`

Outputs are proposals:

- Δ budget;
- Δ schedule;
- material consequences;
- dependent milestones;
- suggested rescheduling.

The optimiser must never commit schedule/payment changes itself. Human approval writes the canonical change.

## Phase 7 — Contractor & Supplier Performance

Implement native scorecards using existing Renova facts:

- on-time completion;
- defects/rework;
- acceptance first-pass rate;
- estimate vs fact;
- response time;
- invoice/payment disputes;
- material delivery reliability.

Twenty CRM is a UX/reference source only.

Never compute a public reputation score from insufficient/private evidence. Scorecards are project/organisation management evidence.

## Phase 8 — Commercial/document references

Use these only where a concrete requirement appears:

- **Documenso**: signing UX/provider patterns; current e-sign boundary stays.
- **Invoice Ninja**: invoice status, numbering and reconciliation patterns; no second accounting ledger.
- **Snipe-IT**: equipment/tool custody only if Renova enters asset management.
- **OpenProject**: project portfolio/dependency UX reference only.

## Cross-cutting tests

Every phase requires:

- project/team ACL negative tests;
- offline/retry/idempotency tests;
- object/evidence checksum validation;
- audit history;
- mobile viewport/E2E path;
- provider unavailable fallback;
- migration reconciliation;
- exact release evidence.

## Explicit prohibitions

Do not:

- replace Renova Project with OpenProject;
- create a second document archive;
- let CV/AI mark work accepted;
- let Timefold write schedule/budget without approval;
- let external signer/invoice service own Renova payment state;
- overwrite original evidence media;
- make annotations destructive.

## Suggested issue order

1. RENOVA-INT-00 Golden-path guard.
2. RENOVA-INT-01 Digital Site Diary.
3. RENOVA-INT-02 Punch/Hold Points.
4. RENOVA-INT-03 Skia evidence markup.
5. RENOVA-INT-04 tus resumable evidence.
6. RENOVA-INT-05 OpenCV before/after.
7. RENOVA-INT-06 C2PA + 360 timeline.
8. RENOVA-INT-07 PDF/drawing annotations.
9. RENOVA-INT-08 IFC contextual layer.
10. RENOVA-INT-09 Change Impact Engine.
11. RENOVA-INT-10 Contractor/Supplier scorecards.

**Implementation instruction:** strengthen the existing execution graph; do not import foreign authorities merely because an external project contains more features.

## Additional wave — secure file admission and privileged access

### ClamAV document/media admission — ADOPT/SIDECAR

Reference: https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/clamav

Renova already accepts project documents/evidence and has OCR. Add malware admission **before** OCR/document processing:

`upload -> temporary quarantine -> ClamAV -> checksum/type validation -> object storage admission -> OCR/preview/index`

A scanner outage is fail-closed for untrusted external uploads in production. Existing trusted/generated internal artefacts may use a separately documented path.

Never send quarantined files into OCR, PDF preview or downstream AI/indexing.

### Passkeys / step-up authentication — ADOPT

Reference: https://github.com/MasterKale/SimpleWebAuthn

Add passkeys to high-risk roles and actions:

- contractor/customer account security;
- project admin;
- acceptance/rejection;
- payment/invoice approval;
- team-access changes;
- export/signature operations.

Passkeys are attached to the current Renova identity. They do not create another account system.

For irreversible/high-value actions, support recent-auth/step-up checks rather than assuming a long-lived mobile session is sufficient.

### Sentry React Native mobile observability — ADOPT

Reference: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-react-native

Backend already has Sentry/OpenTelemetry dependencies. Extend release-aware crash/performance telemetry to the Expo/React Native client.

Correlate:

- mobile release/build;
- route;
- API correlation ID;
- offline queue state class;
- failed domain action class.

Do not capture project photos, document contents, payment data or chat message text by default.

### Additional acceptance

- malicious upload cannot reach OCR/document indexing;
- passkey recovery and lost-device flow are tested;
- mobile crash events resolve to exact app/backend release;
- telemetry redaction rules are covered by tests/review.

**Sequencing:** ClamAV can precede Site Diary expansion; passkeys should follow stable identity/session flows; mobile Sentry can be introduced independently but must use privacy-safe defaults.
